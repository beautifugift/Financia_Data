# Conclusion and Recommendation


# **Conclusion**

1. **Demographic Trends:**
   - There is gender imbalance in investing, with more male investors than female investors.
   - The main age of investing falls within the range of 20-40 years peaking between the ages of 26 and 32 years.
   - Men peak in their investment activities at 27-29 years, then it declines after 30.
- The investment activity of women increases at the age of 27 and then decreases at the age of 31. After that, it rises again at the age of 32 and declines once more at 35.

2. **Sources of Information:**
   - Financial consultants are the leading source for investment information-40% of the time.
   - Traditional media sources, such as newspapers, magazines, and TV, remain very important.
   - The least used source for financial information is surprisingly found on the internet.

3. **Investment Preferences:**
- Debentures and gold are the most popular investment options; government bonds come second.
   - Equity markets, mutual funds, fixed deposits, and PPF are less popular.
   - Medium-term investments are preferred at 3-5 years, followed by short-term investments at 1-3 years.
   - Less than one year or more than 5 years are less considered.
4. **Investment Monitoring and Expectations:**
   - Monthly monitoring is preferred, followed by weekly and daily.
   - Most investors expect high returns (80%) on moderate investments (20-30%).
   - There are slight gender differences in return expectations for different investment levels..

5. **Investment Motivations:**
   - Mutual funds: Better returns, diversification, and tax benefits.
   - Equity: Capital appreciation, dividends, and liquidity.
   - Fixed Deposits: Risk-free nature, fixed returns, and high interest rates.
   - Bonds: Assured returns, safety, and tax incentives.

6. **Savings Goals:**
 The main goals include retirement planning, health, and education.

**Recommendations**

1. **Targeted Marketing and Education:**
 Design focused marketing campaigns to attract more female investors. This could be directed, for instance, at the age groups when they invest the most, at 27-31 years and 32-35 years.
- Design educational programs aimed at the profiles of younger investors aged 20-25 years for the cultivation of early investment behavior.

2. **Diversification of Information Channels:**
   - Consolidate the relationship with financial consultants and, simultaneously, invest in the creation of an online platform and digital marketing targeted towards the young investor.
   - Partnerships with newspapers and magazines are established in content marketing.

3. **Product Development:**
- Create investment products that would correspond to the most general trend, with the horizon of investment ranging between 3-5 years.
 - A hybrid product would combine the characteristics of a debenture with gold and government bonds, meeting current preferences but at the same time introducing variety.
4. **Risk Education:**
 - Educate investors about potential diversification benefits, which could spur a positive impact on currently unpopular equity markets or mutual funds.

5. **Return Expectation Management:**
   - Design communication strategies to manage return expectations, especially for those expecting quite high returns in the tune of 80% on their investments falling within the category of moderate investments.

6. **Gender-Specific Strategies:**
   - Based on small differences in the nature of investment behavior and expectations exhibited by male and female investors, the development of investment products and marketing strategies should be appropriately differentiated.

7. **Goal-Oriented Products:**
- Design investment products and promote them to meet retirement planning, health care costs, and education savings.

8. **Monitoring Tools:**
   - Invest in easy-to-use platforms where monthly, or at least weekly, monitoring of investments is possible.

9. **Tax Benefit Highlight:**
   - Emphasize, from a marketing perspective, the tax benefits for those products in which this appears to be a strong motivator across a wide range of product types.

10. **Age-Specific Outreach:**
- Design investor retention strategies for those attaining 30 years for men and 31 years for women to curb the observed decline in investment activities within these age brackets.

By following these recommendations, you might resolve the gender issue, widen your investor network, be more responsive to the needs and preferences of your current investors, and maybe bring in more diversification into the investment portfolios of these investors.
